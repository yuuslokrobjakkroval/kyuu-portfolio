# kyuu

kyuu is my minimal portfolio website, showcasing my work and experience as a Software Developer & UI/UX Designer. It is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) to deliver a modern, fast, and seamless user experience.

This is a continuously evolving side project where I experiment with new technologies and keep it updated with the latest advancements in web development.
